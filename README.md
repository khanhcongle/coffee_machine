A cup of coffee is the perfect pick-me-up during a break. But what if you could get a cup of coffee without having to lift a finger? That's where my *Coffee Machine (Java)* project comes in.

This project is a simulator of a real-world coffee machine. It works with typical products like coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups. If the machine runs out of something, it will show a notification. You can also get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. And since nothing's for free, the machine also collects money.

This project is a great way to learn about Java programming. It covers a variety of topics, including classes, objects, loops, and conditions. I'm proud of the work I put into this project, and I hope you enjoy using it.
